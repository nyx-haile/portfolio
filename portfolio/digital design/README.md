This folder contains various digital works. The teen zine infographic was created by me using statistics from the Pasadena public library to be published in an issue of the teen zine, and the image titled 'The Final View' is related to my color theory class from the fall of 2017. It is actually a derivative work of my painting for that class. The font is original, and it was designed as an expression of the principle of constraint, and I was limited to the use of only shades and tints of blue.<br/>
The gifs folder contains some of the preliminary sketches I made before finishing my animation of the rivet logo.
